#Pokemon Battle Test (work in progress)

This is a **very basic** Pokemon battle script in Javascript, created for practice and fun while learning Javascript. It is not a fully functional Pokemon fan-game, just a simple RPG battle based on Pokemon mechanics.

This script currently does the following:
* allows Pokemon to take & inflict damage (HP), and raise/lower other stats with specific moves
* calculates damage based on attack/defense stats (or special attack/special defense stats), as well as type advantage/disadvantage
* allows healing with potions and other items
* includes a selection of 8 Pokemon
* includes a few early-game physical, special, and status moves
